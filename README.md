## The Idea
Create an application that allows the user to read content from any RSS feed. The app will consist of 3 activities: one with the list of items (ListView, for selecting content), one for article content display (for reading content), and User Preferences (for user to specify the preferences).

## Preferences
The user should be able to specify in the preferences the URL to the RSS feed (RSS2.0-based or Atom-based), and, the limiting number of items that should be displayed in the ListView (10, 20, 50, 100), and the frequency at which the app fetches the content (10min, 60min, once a day). The app will fetch the RSS feed and populate the list UP to the limit number. When user clicks on a particular item, a detailed view should be shown, with the content of the article for that item.
